**Console color factory.** 

Create a class called **_ColorConsole_** that has just one empty method called _log()_. 

Then, create three subclasses: 
- **RedConsole**, 
- **BlueConsole**
- **GreenConsole**. 

The _log()_ method of every _ColorConsole_ subclass will accept a string as input and will print that string to the console using the color that gives the name to the class. 
Then, create a factory function that takes color as input, such as 'red', and returns the related **ColorConsole** subclass. 
Finally, write a small command-line script to try the new console color factory.
